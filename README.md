Creating My First Web Page

# About Me

I am a professional pianist and harpist working on becoming a coder through Thinkful

# About Website

Just basic HTML and CSS introducing myself to the world, "Hello, World!"
Being my first project, it is very basic and I am excited to grow as I work on more projects

# Thanks

Thank you to the Thinkful team, my mentor, Remington Griffin, my brother, and everyone else who is helping me on this journey into
becoming a computer programmer
