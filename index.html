      <h2><i>My name is </i>Lydia Bandy</h2>
      <p id="AboutMe">
        My name is Lydia Bandy, and I'm on an exciting journey of transformation. I am a professional harpist, pianist,
        and music teacher, known for my musical achievements, including being rated Carroll's Best for music lessons in
        2022 and ranking in the Top 5 piano teachers of Baltimore. I am also a composer, with my music available on
        Spotify and other streaming platforms. Now, I am a student at Thinkful, where I'm studying to become a future
        coder and engineer. I am thrilled to combine my passion for music with my newfound love for technology and
        coding.
      </p>
      <p id="web_development">
        I just started working on coding projects and am learning JavaScript, Web Design, and building a portfolio with
        various projects that I enjoy, from a simple tip calculator to video games. Future languages I would like to
        learn include C++, Python, and Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I look forward to most in the computer programming field is collaborating with others, just like in music.
        I envision coding as a harmonious ensemble, much like a rock band where each instrument, be it drums, keyboard,
        guitar, or vocals, comes together to create a beautiful melody that resonates with people around the world. I am
        excited to bring my unique skill set from the world of music into the realm of technology.
      </p>

      <p id="location">
        I live in a rural area known as Carroll County, Maryland, about 45 minutes outside Baltimore.
