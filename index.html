                üìö Background: For almost two decades, I've been a sought-after music educator, pianist, and harpist
                in the DMV area. As the owner of Lydia's Piano Studio, I honed essential skills while managing my
                business with over 55 students. In 2011, I released my acclaimed piano album, "PIANO PEARLS," available
                on all major streaming platforms. I continue to perform at diverse venues, including libraries,
                churches, airports, 5-star hotels, and Baltimore-area restaurants.

            <p id="therapeutic_music">
                üéº Therapeutic Music Advocate: In 2019, I pioneered a therapeutic music program at Bridge Life
                Healthcare (formerly Carroll County Hospital). There, I provided ambient harp music for patients,
                visitors, and nurses at the Hospice Dove House. This initiative has seen remarkable success, allowing
                me to offer a diverse repertoire of PIANO & CELTIC HARP music and compose original piano pieces for
                various media. My services are available for cocktail parties, weddings, and special events.

            <p id="beyond_notes">
                üåç Beyond the Notes: Beyond my musical passions, I have a deep love for technology and a knack for
                creativity. With 21 COUNTRIES explored, I'm constantly learning and embracing new experiences. I'm an
                avid Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast, a dedicated gamer, and I enjoy exploring 3-D Printing and other
                creative pursuits. My ultimate goal is to combine my love for tech and creativity to build a video game.
