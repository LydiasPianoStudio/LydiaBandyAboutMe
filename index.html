      <h2><i>My name is </i>Lydia Bandy</h2>
      <p id="AboutMe">
        I am a student at Thinkful studying to become a future coder and
        engineer. I am excited to be on this new adventure and look forward to working
        with you!
      </p>
      <p id="web_development">
        I just started working on coding projects and am learning JavaScript,
        Web Design, and building a profolio with various projects that I enjoy from a simple tip calculator to video
        games. Future languages I will like to learn will be C++, Python, and Ruby.
      </p>
      <p> What I look forward to most in the computer programmering field is working with others
        especially on projects where every member brings their unique skill set to the table. I picture coding like a
        rock band where each instrument: drums, keyboard, guitar, vocals all unite as one creating a beautiful melody
        that can reach everyone throughout the world.
      </p>

      <p id="location">
        I live in a rural area known as Carroll County, Maryland. About 45 Minutes Outside Baltimore.</p>
      <p> Feel free to check the links below if you would like to contact me for future projects.</p>
